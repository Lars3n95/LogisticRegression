# LogisticRegression
An example of how to create a simple self-developed Logistic Regression from scratch in Python 

#### Main.py
Shows how to use **LogisticRegression.py**

#### LinearRegression.py
Contains the Logistic Regression using gradient descent

## How to use
You can pull the repository the way it is. Running **Main.py** calls Logistic Regression with the iris dataset (with the first 100 samples). If you just want to use the Logistic Regression you have to call `fit()` with a Numpy Array `X` (m_samples, n_features) and a Numpy Array `y` (m_samples).

## Contribution
If you have an idea how to improve this Logistic Regression keeping it as simple as possible please fork it and make a PR. I'm not 100% sure if it is working correctly, because there is no 'clean' Logistic Regression in scikit-learn with which I can compare my results.
